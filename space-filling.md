## Space-Filling Curves for Data Visualization

Over the summer, I worked on using Space-Filling curves for data visualization at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Fl. Below you can find a write up of some of the work that I did. It is, of course, far from complete, but it might be a good place to start for someone interested in the subject. As part of my early background reading, I also made a tool to visualize and analyze different curves. You can also find that linked below.
