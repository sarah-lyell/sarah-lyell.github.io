# About

I am currently a senior at Williams College in Massachussetts, where I am studying math (among other things). I've also taken a few computer science classes and am planning on taking as many more as I can before graduation. 

This blog started as a way to share some of what I worked on over the summer at my internship, but I plan to make posts about other projects as well. I make no claim at being an expert, but hopefully someone might find the contents of this site to be useful, or at least somewhat entertaining!
